# kimiflow — Feature & Fix Loop

Orchestrates the full loop for: **$ARGUMENTS**

You are the **orchestrator**. Run the phases as a state machine, keep only essentials in context, and load phase details from `phases/` on entry.

## Modes (invocation)

- **Launcher / menu:** **`/kimiflow`**, **`/kimiflow --launcher`**, **`/kimiflow --menu`**, or a vague explicit Kimiflow request ("run Kimiflow") opens a context-aware launcher. It first runs `hooks/launcher-status.sh`, uses `.launcher.primary_action` for one recommendation, and shows the compact `.launcher.status` groups; internal hygiene stays in drilldowns. It never writes code directly and never auto-picks a risky action. → reference.md "Launcher mode".
- **`/kimiflow <feature-or-bug>`** — full run (phases 0–7).
- **Natural mode aliases:** **`/kimiflow full|grill|plan|build|quick|review|audit|fix [target]`** and plain text such as **`kimiflow full`** are first-class shortcuts. If the target is omitted, use the current conversation topic only when it is unambiguous; otherwise ask one plain-language question. Alias meanings:
  - **`full`** — strict full loop, scope=`large`: full grill/spec, understanding/research, plan + acceptance criteria, plan-gate, then **STOP at the pre-build approval gate**. Do not implement until the user approves the plan.
  - **`grill`** — Phase 1 only: clarify/spec in plain language, write `INTENT.md`/`PROBLEM.md`, ask "Does this match?", then STOP. No plan and no code.
  - **`plan`** — prepare only: clarify + understand/diagnose + `PLAN.md`/`ACCEPTANCE.md` + plan-gate, then STOP with a resumable backlog run. No code.
  - **`build`** — implement an approved/prepared Kimiflow plan. If no current approved plan/backlog run is available, ask whether to run `full`, `plan`, or `quick`; do not silently invent a plan.
  - **`quick`** — lean run for small, low-risk work: mandatory micro-grill, normal verification, review light (= ONE code-review lens, `bug-regression`, cross-family when available, plus the advisory scans). Never use when the user asked for `full`, `grill`, or `plan`.
  - **`review`** — alias for `--verify-feature` / current-change review: read-only check of an already-built feature or current diff. No code edits.
  - **`audit`** — alias for `--audit <path>`: read-only cleanup/refactoring scan first; no edits until the user chooses a slice.
  - **`fix`** — alias for `--fix`: bug flow with problem clarification, reproduction/Red evidence, root-cause proof, current fix research, Green evidence, and regression.
- **`/kimiflow … --prepare`** — prepare only: phases 0–4, then STOP. Package in `.kimiflow/<slug>/`; implement later, even in a new session.
- **`/kimiflow --resume <slug>`** — read `.kimiflow/<slug>/STATE.md`, run resume safety, revalidate changed plans before Phase 5; unknown plan basis/affected files → blind implementation is forbidden. Backlog resumes first run the working-tree gate (`OPEN` required — unrelated dirty changes → stop + ask). Without `<slug>` → list runs and ask.
- **Feature or fix:** kimiflow detects whether you are building or fixing a bug, and routes accordingly. Force with **`/kimiflow --fix <bug>`**.
- **Audit / cleanup mode:** kimiflow detects cleanup intent ("remove dead code", "over-engineering audit", "entschlacken", "clean up") and runs an **existence-first cleanup lens** over a **required target path**. Force with **`/kimiflow --audit <path>`**. Staged: it finds tagged slices, shows them for approval (the Phase-4 summary gate), then executes them one slice = one commit with a per-slice verify gate. → reference.md "Audit mode".
- **Existing feature check:** **`/kimiflow --verify-feature <feature-or-path>`** is review-only: independent lenses check an already-built feature, write `FEATURE-CHECK.md`, and confirmed findings route to fix/improve runs only after orchestrator verification. It does not edit code. → reference.md "Existing feature check".
- **Explore mode (opt-in, divergent — feature only):** diverge on **direction** before locking the WHAT. Forced with **`/kimiflow --explore <idea>`**; otherwise kimiflow **offers once** on an open-ended request (decline / headless → normal routing). → reference.md "Explore phase" + the 🧭 section below.
- **Project Map Bootstrap (recommended, skippable):** **`/kimiflow --project-map <quick|standard|deep|skip>`** controls the local `.kimiflow/project/` map and workqueue. `.kimiflow/project/` is never auto-committed; publish-safe repo docs omit concrete vulnerabilities, exploit paths, secrets, and private/local paths. Declining/`skip` never blocks.
- **Display verbosity (visible output only — engine identical at every level):** `--quiet`/`--verbose` set the level for one run (never persisted); `--set-verbosity <level>` and `--settings` write config and exit. → Phase 0 step 7 + reference.md "Display verbosity".
- **Pre-build summary gate:** end of Phase 4, before building: structured summary waits for your OK — *approve* → build · *change* → revise · *defer → backlog*.

## Core principles (apply in ALL phases)

- **Language:** reply in the user's language for chat and artifacts.
- **Terse output (HARD RULE — governs every phase; this is where runs bloat).** The `balanced` baseline (display-verbosity scales only the volume, never the engine → reference.md "Display verbosity"). Visible output is control-plane only: a phase line, the gate verdict, the decisive evidence, a question when you need one. Concretely:
  - **(a) One-line phase announcements** — marker + name + ≤1 clause. Never a paragraph.
  - **(b) NEVER paste a full artifact into chat** (INTENT/PROBLEM/RESEARCH/DIAGNOSIS/PLAN/ACCEPTANCE). Write it to its file; show a ≤3-line summary + the path.
  - **(c) Gate verdict = ONE line** — e.g. `gate open · open BLOCKER/HIGH: 0`. No narrative; reasoning lives in `REVIEW.md`.
  - **(d) Evidence = the command + only the decisive output line(s)**, never a full log dump.
  - **(e) No STATE *narration* in chat, no recap tables, no restating what a subagent will do or just did.** Use the Phase-0 task-list widget for glance status, not prose. **Narration ≠ persistence:** terse-output suppresses *talking about* state in chat — it **never** removes writing `STATE.md` / the phase artifacts to disk.
  - **Budget: ≤~6 lines of your own prose per phase**, outside required summaries/evidence.
- **Artifact economy (terse output, for files).** On-disk artifacts (INTENT/PROBLEM/RESEARCH/DIAGNOSIS/PLAN/ACCEPTANCE/findings) are re-read by every fresh subagent every round — write them dense: structured fields + evidence only, no narration or padding. Density NEVER costs rigor — keep every required field, every `file:line`, all evidence, full acceptance precision (EARS + example + method + `AC-N → test_name`). State this density requirement in every artifact-producing delegation's output spec.
- **Self-contained — the skill is the authority.** Every gate, threshold and standard lives here (+ reference.md), never in a personal/global `CLAUDE.md`; kimiflow runs identically with or without one. It consults the project's `CLAUDE.md` only as an optional Phase-2 conventions hint — never for gate criteria, scores, or thresholds, and never attribute a kimiflow gate to one.
- **Simplicity-first.** Minimal code/plan for the problem. No speculative abstractions, no features beyond the request.
- **Anti-hallucination.** Only claims you can back. "Not verifiable" is valid. Severity never higher than provable by a code reference.
- **Evidence-before-assertion.** Never claim "done/green/root cause found" without showing the actual command + output / the `file:line`.
- **Agent budget.** Fan out to ~5–10 subagents when useful. Beyond ~10 → stop and ask the user first. Fold into an existing brief unless independence/blindness matters.
- **Model routing.** Session model plans/builds/verifies; a different model family takes one review lens when available. Details/fallback → reference.md "Model routing (per-role)".
- **Persist phase progress (NOT optional, NOT terse-trimmable).** Phase 0 creates `.kimiflow/<slug>/STATE.md`; after every phase set `Phase N: open|in-progress|done`. Chat state is not enough: `state-gate` blocks the review-gate call when `STATE.md` is missing.
- **Active Session Contract (not optional once Kimiflow starts).** Non-trivial runs start `hooks/active-run.sh start --run .kimiflow/<slug> --write`; follow-ups stay in that run until explicit exit/abort/park/fail/switch. Close mechanically with `finish|park|fail|abort --write`.
- **Background Handles (optional, visible from launcher).** Register long read-only/draft work through `hooks/background-run.sh`; collect only through the foreground orchestrator. Stale/failed/cancelled work cannot be applied blindly.
- **Agentic Readiness Layer (local, no network).** Before background trust, autonomous continuation, handoff reuse, or write-capable fan-out, consult `hooks/agentic-readiness.sh status|gate`; use `packet --write` for bounded packets.
- **Stop criteria always active:** success-stop (gate/verification met), failure-stop (escalate — see phase 5), budget-stop (cap reached → stop + ask). Never loop forever.
- **Subagents do NOT see your context.** Every delegation carries: objective, output format, allowed files/boundaries, the paths of the relevant state files. For reference.md content, pass the path `${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}/reference.md` + the exact section names to read — not the text verbatim (verbatim only for a snippet under ~15 lines). Subagents write results to the named paths.

## Phase Files (on-demand)

Phase detail is loaded only when entering that phase. For post-R2 runs, `hooks/active-run.sh start --run .kimiflow/<slug> --write` marks `phase_reads_required: true`; read `phases/PHASES.json`, read the phase file, then record it with `hooks/active-run.sh phase-read --run .kimiflow/<slug> --phase <N> --file phases/<file>.md --write` before crossing the next gate boundary. `clarify-gate.sh` checks through Phase 1, `plan-blocker-gate.sh` through Phase 4, and `finish --write` through Phase 7.

| Phase | File | Always-loaded boundary cues |
|---|---|---|
| 0 Setup, Routing & Scope-Gate | `phases/phase-0-setup.md` | `launcher-status.sh --pretty`; `working-tree-gate.sh`; `active-run.sh`; phase state; scope and verbosity gates. |
| Explore + 1 Clarify | `phases/phase-1-clarify.md` | optional Explore; `clarify-gate.sh`; mandatory micro-grill evidence; `Does this match?` / problem/scope gates. |
| 2 Understand / diagnose | `phases/phase-2-understand.md` | `memory-router.sh status`; `MR recall --query-file`; Vault Pulse; Current-State Pulse / Gate; `current-state-gate.sh`; `suggest-affected-sections.sh`. |
| 3 Plan | `phases/phase-3-plan.md` | acceptance criteria, Red evidence for fix mode, cause proof, audit existence-first rules. |
| 4 Plan-gate / approval | `phases/phase-4-review-approval.md` | `plan-blocker-gate.sh`; reviewer lenses; `resolve-review-gate.sh`; pre-build approval stop; build-gate STOP/backlog rules. |
| 5 Implement / fix | `phases/phase-5-build.md` | TDD, named Red-test commit exception, caller-grep before deletion, failure escalation. |
| 6 Verify | `phases/phase-6-verify.md` | goal-backward verification; `red-green-gate.sh`; `lsp-diagnostics.sh`; regression and cold-start checks. |
| 7 Review / commit | `phases/phase-7-review-commit.md` | code-review ensemble; Memory Router & Learning Loop; `agentic-readiness.sh packet`; `CANDIDATE` verification; named-path staging; advisory scans; `MR review-run`; `refresh --changed`; `improvements-status.sh`; `Status: done`. |

## Scaling Knobs

Detailed knobs live in `docs/kimiflow-scaling-knobs.md`. Display verbosity is NOT a knob: it is always-on visible-output volume only, never gates, cost, quality, or behavior. Best-of-2 keeps the test oracle authored and committed BEFORE fan-out; candidates stay uncommitted; behavioral evals are never wired into CI.
