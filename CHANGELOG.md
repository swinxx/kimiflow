# Changelog

Notable changes to **kimiflow**. Versions track `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

## Unreleased

Audit-hardening: a 7-lens adversarial baseline audit of the flow prose, the hook layer, and the memory-router Python package; every confirmed finding fixed test-first.

### Fixed
- **Hook manifests quote `${KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT}` expansions** (`hooks/hooks.json`, Codex `hooks.json`): an install path containing spaces word-split the hook commands (exit 126/127), silently **failing open** every PreToolUse gate. New `hooks/test-hooks-json.sh` runs each manifest command from a spaced plugin root.
- **`active-run.sh` no longer blocks every prompt when `jq` is missing:** the `prompt-context`/`stop-gate` entry points degraded from exit 2 (which froze all sessions in all repos) to exit 0 (context/nudge skipped); CLI subcommands still require jq.
- **`plan-blocker-gate.sh` audit-mode deadlock:** audit runs never produce PLAN/ACCEPTANCE, but the gate demanded them. An audit profile (mode from STATE.md, fallback AUDIT-INTENT ∧ ¬PLAN) now requires AUDIT.md path evidence + affected paths + clarify recheck instead.
- **`resolve-review-gate.sh` cross-phase isolation:** anti-oscillation/reappeared checks globbed `r<N>-*.md` across ALL lenses, so Phase-4 leftovers masked genuine Phase-7 oscillation (a mandatory stop was suppressed). Previous-round checks are now `--expect`-scoped; `round`/`cap` are base-10-normalized (no octal crash on `08`).
- **`commit-secret-gate.sh` bulk-add bypasses closed:** `git add ./`, `git add :/`, and `:(top)` pathspecs (whole-tree synonyms) now hit the bulk-stage block, including `-A` flag clusters and quoted forms.
- **memory-router path traversal (`rows.py`):** `../`-evidence refs escaped the repo-root check, so out-of-repo files (e.g. `/etc/hosts`) were hashed into `evidence_fingerprints`. Paths are now lexically normalized before the root check; escaping refs map to `OUTSIDE_REPO` (spec §12).
- **memory-router rewrite data loss (`writes.py`/`store.py`):** the status=current full-rewrite dropped blank/malformed lines from `LEARNINGS.jsonl` that the append path preserved. The rewrite now keeps unparseable lines verbatim, in place (spec §12).
- **Smoke expectations aligned with the hardened manifests and B1 wording** (`hooks/smoke-install.sh`): the closeback-nudge manifest greps now expect the quoted `${KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT…}` forms introduced by the fail-open fix, and the SKILL.md check greps `Current-State Pulse / Gate`. The smoke had silently reported 3 failures since those fixes landed; B4's per-commit smoke loop caught it.
- **memory-router security-gate scope (`writes.py`/`rows.py`):** the gate scanned only `summary` — injection phrases or hidden unicode in `topic`/`evidence` passed through, and bare secret values kept `sensitivity=normal`, making such rows vault-sync candidates. The gate now scans summary+topic+evidence (newline-joined, no cross-field matches), and a minimal secret-value pattern class (AWS key ids, PEM headers, GitHub/Slack tokens, long `key=value` literals) forces `sensitivity=security` — recorded locally, quarantined from sync (spec §12).

### Added
- **`kimiflow_core` R1 foundation:** added the stdlib Python package skeleton, shared contracts/path/state/atomic helpers, unit wrapper, old-vs-new parity harness, and divergence-ledger spec for the large-script rebuild before any production shim cutover.
- **`launcher-status.sh --full`; the default output is now the compact first screen.** Without the flag, the heavy arrays (`runs.items` — 13K+ chars on run-heavy repos — and `background.items`) and the full `memory` object are omitted; all counts, `memory_summary`, `maintenance`, and the `.launcher` block are unchanged. The snapshot is still computed in full — the trim is serialization-only, so maintenance reasons and the `.launcher` status stay byte-identical. Drilldown prose in `reference.md` points at `--full`.

### Changed
- **Rebuild program planning:** added the audited R0-R4 rebuild program and R1 detail plan for the `kimiflow_core` port, including mandatory old-vs-new parity, multi-target invariant preservation, and no-open-BLOCKER/HIGH plan-audit gates before implementation.
- **`improvements-status.sh` now runs through `kimiflow_core`:** the workqueue close-back helper keeps its CLI contract through the old-vs-new parity harness, with mutating commands now failing closed on an explicit invalid `--root`.
- **SKILL.md compacted (two passes, 60,463 → 53,277 bytes) with a mechanical preservation contract:** pass 2 (sentence-level, deletions only) confirmed the honest floor — the remaining text is ~85% protected rules (gate commands, STOPs, fail-closed rules, prohibitions per the invariants artifact), so the original ≤30K goal is not reachable without rule loss; the real per-run token cuts come from the launcher/reviewer/commit-hygiene levers above. Duplicate enumerations, restated reference prose and the 4K learning-loop line were reduced to their operative cores + pointers; every gate command, STOP, fail-closed rule and prohibition is enumerated in `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-02-token-restructuring-invariants.md` and verified by a needle grep-check (`…/2026-07-02-invariant-check.sh`, validated against the pre-compaction file first). Reviewer spawn contract tightened: reviewers no longer read `reference.md` — each spawn prompt inlines its lens definition + the FINDING/CANDIDATE grammar incl. the file-form constraints the fail-closed resolver enforces; lens A/B definitions are now canonical in the "Review rubric" (additive), Phase 7 gained the orchestrator rubric-read step.
- **Commit-secret-gate maintainer prose moved out of the instruction path** (`reference.md` "Commit hygiene" → new `docs/commit-secret-gate.md`): enforcement mechanics, the full pattern deny-list, parsing boundaries and residual gaps live in the doc; the reference section keeps the operative rules (red-test exception, 6 commit rules, hook activation scope, secret-content-scan advisory, hygiene-backstop bottom line) plus pointers. The LSP-advisory paragraph became a pointer to "Verification" (single copy, `KIMIFLOW_LSP_MAX_COMMANDS` detail folded there).
- **Flow-prose coherence fixes** (SKILL.md, reference.md): the `full` alias forces the pre-build approval stop even with `build-gate off`; Phase 7 stages named paths *before* the advisory scans (they previously read an empty staged diff); the Phase-5 resume path runs through the working-tree gate (own reference section); the Phase-5 red-test commit is the single defined exception to the commit-hygiene rule; best-of-2 candidate failure degrades to best-of-1 (the implementer seat never substitutes same-family); audit-mode reviewers receive `AUDIT-INTENT.md` + `AUDIT.md`; `quick` is defined as one `bug-regression` lens + advisory scans; phantom "split promoted files" wording removed and Current-State Pulse/Gate pointers aligned.
- **CI test discovery** (`.github/workflows/ci.yml`): the 19 hard-coded test steps are replaced by a discovery loop over all `hooks/test-*.sh` (production hooks excluded), so new suites gate CI automatically; `shellcheck --severity=error` is a hard gate.

## 0.1.55

Ship **calm launcher status UX**.

## 0.1.54


Agentic quality upgrade: kimiflow now uses model diversity, test-oracle selection, and independent verification by default where cheap — closing review blind spots when the session model reviews its own family's output.

### Added
- **Per-role model routing** (`reference.md` "Model routing (per-role)"): session model takes planner/implementer/verification seats, a cross-family CLI takes one review lens per gate, the smallest tier takes narrow read-only lenses; pinned transport (`codex exec --output-last-message` on Claude Code, `claude -p` on Codex), explicit timeouts, sticky same-family fallback, and a project-local `.kimiflow/cross-family` `auto|off` opt-out (also settable via `--settings`).
- **Dual-plan selection at `large`** (Phase 3): two independent planners with distinct framings (minimal-first vs risk-first, one cross-family when available); selection-first synthesis — the losing approach becomes the recorded "Considered alternatives" entry.
- **Best-of-2 auto-offer** (pre-build gate): at `large` with a fully test-encoded acceptance set and a cross-family CLI available, the shown pre-build summary offers two candidate implementations in parallel worktrees judged by the test oracle; candidates never commit — the oracle is committed in the main worktree before fan-out and the winning diff goes through the normal commit-gated path.
- **Additive independent verifier at `large`** (Phase 6): an implementer-blind verifier re-derives the goal-backward sweep and tries to falsify "done" claims; discrepancies are adjudicated by the orchestrator re-running the decisive command — an unverified claim never steers control flow.
- **Cross-family escalation step** (Phase 5): after two failed fix attempts, the failure evidence goes to a bounded cross-family diagnosis call; its hypothesis is candidate-only.
- **Refutation requirement** (Phase 7): BLOCKER/HIGH candidates must survive an active refutation attempt before promotion — false blockers no longer burn fix rounds.

### Changed
- **Cross-family review is now the default, not a knob:** one plan-gate lens and one code-review lens route to a different model family whenever a cross-family CLI is available (scope ≥ `small`); external reviewer output is persisted verbatim as the lens's findings file with an exhaustively defined malformed-retry/fallback path — the fail-closed resolver stays the only grammar authority.
- **Agent budget disambiguated:** the ~5–10 automatic budget applies per fan-out decision (not cumulatively per run); `large` runs disclose their expected ensemble at the scope announcement and in the pre-build summary's new "Knobs" line.
- **Resume re-approval:** resuming a `backlog` run into Phase 5 re-presents the pre-build summary when the build-gate is on, so deferred plans get the same approval as direct runs.
- Scaling-knobs heading reworded (defaults scale with scope); README cost notes updated (EN/DE).

## 0.1.53

A correctness fix for the project-map hook: `refresh --changed` no longer crashes on large deltas under macOS Bash 3.2, and `test-project-map-status.sh` is now a CI hard gate.

### Fixed
- **`project-map-status.sh refresh --changed` no longer crashes on large deltas.** `do_refresh_changed` recomputed the per-section prefix/member attribution *inside* the per-changed-path loop, spawning `O(changed-paths × sections)` process substitutions. On macOS Bash 3.2 a delta with many new unmapped files (e.g. several sessions' worth of new docs) exhausted file descriptors and died with SIGTRAP (exit 133) — so the Phase-7 auto-refresh and the Stop-hook map-staleness nudge's recommended `bring-current` path silently failed. The attribution is now precomputed once and matched in pure shell (zero subshells in the hot loop); behaviour is unchanged (longest-prefix-wins, ties resolve to the first section). The now-orphaned `section_owns`/`longest_prefix_len` helpers were removed.

### Changed
- **`hooks/test-project-map-status.sh` is now a CI hard gate**, with a new regression test for the crash above. It previously ran only locally and as a `bash -n` smoke check, so the `refresh --changed` path was never exercised in CI.

## 0.1.52

The `memory-router` hook is now powered by the Python (stdlib) port. `hooks/memory-router.sh` is a thin shim that execs `python3 -m memory_router`, and the ~4400-line Bash implementation has been removed. The CLI contract is unchanged — every subcommand was ported byte-for-byte and grounded against the pinned `kimiflow--v0.1.50` Bash.

### Changed
- **memory-router runtime cut over to Python.** `hooks/memory-router.sh` now execs the stdlib `hooks/memory_router/` package across all 13 subcommands (`classify`, `index`, `status`, `curate`, `record`, `recall`, `history`, `metrics`, `verify-run`, `consolidate`, `propose`, `review-run`, `provider`). The Bash logic is deleted; behaviour is byte-for-byte identical — verified by the parity harness, the full Python test suite (run under system `python3` 3.9.6), and a direct shim spot-check (`status`/`verify-run`/`metrics`/`provider`/`classify`/`--help`/unknown-command all identical to the pinned Bash).
- `hooks/test-memory-router-unit.sh` now runs the **full** `memory_router` test suite via discovery (was: three foundation modules), so all of it gates CI and releases.

### Added
- **Runtime requirement: `python3` >= 3.9** for the memory-router hook (documented in `COMPATIBILITY.md`). The previous Bash runtime already required `jq`.

### Removed
- `hooks/test-memory-router.sh` — the legacy Bash-implementation unit test, superseded by the Python suite + the parity harness. Its three Bash-only assertions (a `curl` stub and `openssl`/`shasum`-absent stubs) tested stdlib divergences (`urllib`/`hashlib`) that no longer apply.

## 0.1.51

Additive Python (stdlib) port of the `memory-router` hook, built and verified behind the scenes. The Bash `hooks/memory-router.sh` stays the active runtime — this release ships the new `hooks/memory_router/` package and its test suite alongside it, with no cutover and no behaviour change yet.

### Added
- **`memory_router` Python package** — a stdlib-only port of `memory-router.sh`, grounded byte-for-byte against the pinned `kimiflow--v0.1.50` Bash. Wired subcommands: `classify`, `index`, `status`, `curate`, `record`, `recall`, `history`, over the full read/write/recall stack — bounded `MEMORY.md`/`USER.md` writers, the learning-row write path + security gate, the `RECALL.sqlite` FTS5 engine + index builder, the summary aggregators (usage/economics/lifecycle/global-efficiency), the provider/vault status chain, and the `MEMORY-USAGE.json` metrics writer. Shared layers: jq-faithful JSON serialization, atomic IO + lenient readers, and row/path/text/clock primitives.
- **Parity + unit test suite** (`hooks/memory_router/tests/`) including harnesses that shell to the pinned Bash for byte-for-byte verification, gated into CI and the release loop.

### Fixed
- **memory_router parity hardening**: UTF-8-tolerant `word_count_file`; newline-faithful `--input`/parity reads; location-independent parity launch (`PYTHONPATH` + `-m`); a bash-3.2 empty-array false-green under `set -u`; and a Bash-style unknown-command error (stderr + exit 2).

### Changed
- Planning + handoff docs for the port (`docs/superpowers/`), the CLI design spec, and `.gitignore` for Python bytecode + SDD scratch.

## 0.1.50

ShellCheck cleanup across the hooks: a real `local` path-derivation bug plus dead `case` patterns, unused variables, and two error-level parsing ambiguities.

### Fixed
- **ShellCheck hygiene across `hooks/`**: split compound `local` declarations so derived path variables
  (`state`/`file`/`project`/`salt_file`) read the just-bound `$1`/`$2` instead of a masked outer value
  (9× SC2318 latent bug in `active-run.sh`, `agentic-readiness.sh`, `memory-router.sh`); dropped dead
  `case` alternatives `*routes*` / `migrations/*` in `project-map-status.sh` (strict subsets of `*route*`
  / `*migration*`, behaviour identical — SC2221/SC2222); removed the unused `pretty` variable in
  `clarify-gate.sh` / `plan-blocker-gate.sh` (the `--pretty` flag stays an accepted no-op) and the unused
  `handoff` in `background-run.sh` (SC2034); and disambiguated `$((` → `$( (` in
  `test-commit-secret-gate.sh` / `test-lsp-diagnostics.sh` (SC1102, error-level). Repo-wide error-level
  ShellCheck items: 2 → 0; all hook test suites stay green.

## 0.1.49

Close the local workqueue loop: built `IMPROVEMENTS.md`/`FINDINGS.md` slices get marked done so the launcher stops counting them as open.

### Added
- **Workqueue close-back** (`hooks/improvements-status.sh` + tests): a `list` / `mark-done <id>` / `reopen <id>` helper
  that marks a built slice from `.kimiflow/project/IMPROVEMENTS.md` (`## Priorisierte Slices`) or `FINDINGS.md`
  (`## Offen`) done via an idempotent in-place `<!-- kimiflow:queue-done -->` marker (stable slug/token ids, atomic
  write). The `hooks/launcher-status.sh` counter gains an optional done-marker argument — with a `length>0`
  backward-compat guard — and no longer counts marked slices as open. A non-blocking Stop-hook nudge
  (`hooks/improvements-staleness-nudge.sh`, registered in both `hooks.json` and `hooks/hooks.json`) reminds at most once
  per day, and only when a run just completed while open slices remain. Documented as Phase-7 step 8a
  "Workqueue close-back" in `SKILL.md`, `skills/kimiflow/SKILL.md`, and `reference.md`, with Claude + Codex smoke
  assertions and CI unit tests.

## 0.1.48

Release-hygiene check, consistent capability display, and project-map outputs framed as a local workqueue.

### Added
- **Release version-consistency check** (`hooks/release-consistency-check.sh` + test): a manual pre-release helper
  that verifies one version across `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`, `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`,
  `.claude-plugin/marketplace.json`, `COMPATIBILITY.md`, and a `## <ver>` `CHANGELOG.md` heading (manifest version
  fields without a value are skipped). Wired as a CI unit test — not a release gate.
- **Capability-display sync + drift guard**: the four core capabilities (feature/fix loop, project intelligence,
  repo docs, local findings) are now named consistently across `README`, the Claude plugin/marketplace
  descriptions, and the Codex `shortDescription` surfaces, with per-field smoke assertions that fail if a
  capability is dropped (README via a delimited capabilities block; Codex per `shortDescription`).

### Changed
- **Project-map outputs documented as a local workqueue**: `reference.md` and `SKILL.md` now describe
  `FINDINGS.md`/`IMPROVEMENTS.md`/`DOCS-PLAN.md` as an actionable local workqueue — findings/improvement slices are
  launcher-surfaced and picked up by later fix/build runs; `DOCS-PLAN.md` is the docs-run output — not a static report.

## 0.1.47

Keep the **project map fresh automatically** after Kimiflow runs, surface staleness, and make section lookup token-cheap.

### Added
- **A1 — `project-map-status.sh refresh --changed`**: after a run, auto-restamps the map sections whose files changed
  (matched by `.files` membership or longest prefix), prunes deleted files, adopts new files under a section prefix,
  re-indexes their `.sh` symbols, and advances the baseline (idempotent for committed deltas). Wired into the Phase-7
  step in `SKILL.md`, so the project map no longer goes stale after building with Kimiflow.
- **A2 — `map-staleness-nudge.sh`**: a non-blocking `Stop` hook that surfaces a `systemMessage` when the local
  project map is stale (rate-limited; resolves its helper by absolute path before `cd`). Registered in both
  `hooks.json` and `hooks/hooks.json`, so map drift is visible even after non-Kimiflow edits.
- **B1 — `project-map-status.sh index-symbols`**: a dependency-free `.sh` symbol→section index stored under
  `sections.<name>.symbols` in `INDEX.json` (additive; `schema_version` unchanged).
- **B4 — `suggest-affected-sections.sh`**: ranks the likely-affected map sections (with representative paths for
  `coverage --affected`) from intent/problem terms, so Phase 2 stops guessing affected paths blind.

## 0.1.46

Fix the **false agentic-readiness MCP warning**; ship Claude Obsidian MCP auto-setup.

### Fixed
- `agentic-readiness.sh` surfaced `mcp_not_direct_ready` even when an authenticated Obsidian/Vault MCP was
  connected, because it read only the static `.kimiflow/project/VAULT-PROVIDER.json` — which `provider connect`
  writes without live capabilities. It now honors the local `KIMIFLOW_VAULT_MCP_AVAILABLE` /
  `KIMIFLOW_OBSIDIAN_MCP_AVAILABLE` session signal (env only, no network), matching the precedence already used in
  `memory-router.sh` provider auth, so a connected host MCP clears the false warning.

### Changed
- The Obsidian Vault MCP wizard (`vault-mcp-setup.sh --host claude --write-config`, used by the interactive
  `vault-mcp-open-terminal.sh` flow) now applies the Claude Code MCP server automatically via `claude mcp add-json`
  instead of only printing the JSON snippet. It replaces any existing user-scope `obsidian` server — including an
  older stdio `mcp-obsidian` entry with an inline key — so no stale plaintext token lingers in `~/.claude.json`;
  the key stays in macOS Keychain and is read at connection time by the headers helper. This brings Claude setup to
  parity with the existing Codex `--write-config` automation.

## 0.1.45

Ship **Agentic Readiness Layer**.

## 0.1.44

Ship **natural Kimiflow mode shortcuts** for Claude Code and Codex.

### Added
- Added first-class `full`, `grill`, `plan`, `build`, `quick`, `review`, `audit`, and `fix` aliases to the
  canonical Kimiflow contract, Codex wrapper, launcher docs, README, and plugin metadata.
- `full` now explicitly forces the strict full loop with grill/spec, research, plan-gate, and a pre-build approval
  stop before implementation.

### Changed
- Install smokes now verify the alias contract across Claude Code, Codex, README, launcher docs, and plugin metadata
  with stricter checks for the no-code aliases.

## 0.1.43


### Added
- Added local Background Handles for long-running read-only or draft-producing Kimiflow work such as deep codebase
  analysis, docs drafts, security/advisory review, and improvement scans.
- Added `hooks/background-run.sh` and tests for handle start/list/status/update/collect/cancel/stale flows,
  stale affected-path detection, unsafe path rejection, and fail-closed corrupted status handling.
- Launcher status now surfaces collectable and stale background handles as maintenance reasons.

### Changed
- README, reference docs, plugin metadata, install smokes, and CI now document and verify the Background Handles
  workflow for Claude Code and Codex.

## 0.1.42

Ship **working-tree, red/green, and local diagnostics gates**.

### Added
- Normal write-mode Kimiflow runs now require a clean working tree before starting, while ignoring local `.kimiflow/`
  state.
- Fix runs now use a Red/Green evidence gate around `BUG-REPRO.md` before review, learning promotion, or completion.
- Local diagnostics now run as a bounded advisory using existing typecheck/lint/LSP-adjacent tools or an untracked
  local `.kimiflow/lsp-diagnostics` command.
- CI now runs the new working-tree, red/green, and local diagnostics unit tests explicitly.

## 0.1.41

Ship **Harden review lifecycle and active-session safety gates**.

## 0.1.40

Ship **global local memory efficiency metrics**.

## 0.1.39

Ship **Stabilize CI tests and keep maintainer notes local**.

## 0.1.38

Ship **memory-economics normalization and commit-hook hardening**.

### Added
- README now documents the repository structure in English and German, including which generated `.kimiflow/`
  project-intelligence files should stay local by default.

### Fixed
- `memory-router.sh metrics` now normalizes older run-economics rows to the current `used_hit_count` heuristic
  so legacy `recall_hit_count` estimates cannot inflate token-savings totals.
- `commit-secret-gate.sh` now fails closed for malformed git-like hook payloads inside Kimiflow repositories,
  while preserving no-op behavior for malformed payloads outside `.kimiflow/` scope.

## 0.1.37

Ship **Memory Economics and searchable review findings** for the Kimiflow learning loop.

### Added
- `memory-router.sh recall --write` now writes a run-local `RECALL.json` beside `RECALL.md`.
- `review-run --write` now records directional run-level token-efficiency telemetry in
  `.kimiflow/project/MEMORY-ECONOMICS.jsonl`.
- `status`, `metrics`, and `curate --write` now expose memory-economics summaries while preserving legacy
  usage-economics fields.
- Local run history and FTS recall now include review summaries and canonical `.kimiflow/<slug>/findings/*.md`
  so Kimiflow can recall prior review findings after the gate closes.

### Fixed
- Token-savings estimates now use `used_hit_count` instead of all recall hits, avoiding inflated savings claims.
- Generic `REVIEW.md` prose stays searchable local run history but is no longer promoted into durable
  `LEARNINGS.jsonl` entries.
- Docs and plugin metadata now point installs at the `kimikonapps/kimiflow` Git marketplace.

## 0.1.36

Ship **frictionless Obsidian Vault MCP setup** for Codex and Claude Code.

### Added
- Memory Router provider status now auto-detects a running Obsidian Local REST API on the common local ports
  and reports `provider_detected_unconfigured` until the user connects it.
- Added `provider detect` / `provider connect` for a frictionless local Obsidian setup that writes only
  `.kimiflow/project/VAULT-PROVIDER.json` and never stores an Obsidian API key.
- Added `provider health` with `detected_unconfigured`, `connected_local_only`, `authenticated`, and `auth_failed`
  states, plus auth-ready capabilities without storing API keys in `.kimiflow/`.
- Added `provider setup` and `hooks/vault-mcp-setup.sh` for safe Obsidian Local REST API MCP setup:
  Codex uses `bearer_token_env_var = "OBSIDIAN_API_KEY"`, Claude Code uses `headersHelper`, and non-loopback
  URLs are refused before any token-bearing setup is printed.
- Added `hooks/vault-mcp-open-terminal.sh`, an interactive macOS Terminal wizard that writes host config, stores the
  API key in Keychain, verifies local auth, and keeps the key out of chat and `.kimiflow/`.
- Provider prefetch/sync handoffs now include health/auth readiness, so direct Vault search/write is used only
  when authenticated and otherwise stays as reviewable local `VAULT-PREFETCH.md` / `VAULT-SYNC.md`.
- Launcher/README/skill docs now describe the V2 flow: detect Obsidian, connect locally, check health/auth, print
  host-owned MCP setup, then use direct Vault search/write only when authenticated.

## 0.1.35

Ship **bounded Vault sync handoffs** for the Memory Provider lifecycle.

### Added
- Memory Router now supports optional local FTS5 recall via `.kimiflow/project/RECALL.sqlite` and `index --write`.
- Added `history --query ... --write` for bounded old-run/session recall snapshots in `RUN-HISTORY.json` /
  `RUN-HISTORY.md`.
- Added persisted recall/history usage metrics in `MEMORY-USAGE.json` plus lifecycle curation metadata in
  `MEMORY-INDEX.json`.
- Added `provider status|configure|prefetch` for local optional Vault/Obsidian provider manifests and bounded
  `VAULT-PREFETCH.md` handoffs.
- Added `record --scope user` with local-only `USER.jsonl` / `USER.md` profile memory.
- Added `consolidate --write` to archive superseded learning rows without silent deletion.
- Added `propose --write` to generate review-only rule/skill proposals from evidence-backed learnings.
- Approved skill/workflow proposals now create review-only drafts under `.kimiflow/project/SKILL-DRAFTS/` instead
  of patching skill files automatically.
- Added `provider sync --write` to create `.kimiflow/project/VAULT-SYNC.md` from current, non-private,
  non-security learnings with freshly verified repo-relative evidence.
- Launcher and memory status now report `provider.sync` and `provider_sync_pending` so omitted Vault sync
  candidates stay visible until exported.

### Fixed
- Refreshed learning rows now supersede older rows with changed evidence fingerprints, and recall returns only
  `current` learnings.
- Outside-repo evidence paths are sanitized to `OUTSIDE_REPO` before persistence.
- Evidence fingerprints now store an explicit digest algorithm and digest; `sha256` is populated only when the
  digest is actually SHA-256.
- Active memory writes are now blocked when they contain prompt-injection, hidden-instruction, or credential
  exfiltration patterns.
- Provider sync recomputes evidence fingerprints before export so stale or changed evidence rows are not written
  to the Vault handoff.
- Vault sync handoffs are capped by `${KIMIFLOW_PROVIDER_SYNC_MAX:-20}`, and only exported IDs are marked synced.

## 0.1.34

Add **quality and source-freshness gates** to the Learning Loop.

### Added
- `review-run` now blocks low-quality learning candidates before writing: too short, generic, missing verified
  evidence, decisions without a decision, rules without a rule, or pitfalls without an avoidance signal.
- Learning rows now include `evidence_fingerprints` so `verify-run` can detect when source evidence changed
  after the run-close review.
- `verify-run` now returns `CLOSED reason=evidence_stale` when a recorded learning's evidence file changed,
  is missing, or lacks a current fingerprint.
- Memory-router tests cover evidence fingerprints, stale evidence, refresh after evidence changes, and
  low-quality learning rejection.

## 0.1.33

Harden the **Learning Loop close gate** after code review.

### Fixed
- `memory-router.sh verify-run` now validates every `Recorded: learn_*` ID against current rows in
  `.kimiflow/project/LEARNINGS.jsonl` instead of trusting the review markdown alone.
- Learning recording no longer reuses stale or superseded rows as proof of a fresh completed run; repeated
  proof appends a new current row while current duplicates remain idempotent.
- Memory-router tests cover forged/missing recorded IDs and stale-learning reconfirmation.

## 0.1.32

Close the **Learning Loop** mechanically for completed Kimiflow runs.

### Added
- `memory-router.sh review-run` writes `.kimiflow/<slug>/LEARNING-REVIEW.md`, records the four-question
  learning set in `.kimiflow/project/LEARNINGS.jsonl`, refreshes bounded `MEMORY.md`, and updates the
  memory index.
- `memory-router.sh verify-run` fails closed when a run has no learning review, no recorded learning IDs, or
  a skipped review without an explicit reason.
- Memory-router tests cover recorded reviews, explicit skip reviews, index refresh, and the missing-review
  blocker.

### Changed
- Phase 7 now requires `review-run` + `verify-run` before `STATE.md` may be marked `Status: done`.
- README, reference docs, and install smokes now surface `LEARNING-REVIEW.md`, `review-run`, and `verify-run`
  as part of the Kimiflow memory contract.

## 0.1.31

Ship the **Memory Router and Learning Loop** for token-cheap project recall.

### Added
- `hooks/memory-router.sh` with `status`, `recall`, `classify`, `record`, and `curate` commands for local
  `.kimiflow/project/` memory artifacts (`MEMORY.md`, `LEARNINGS.jsonl`, `MEMORY-INDEX.json`, `RECALL.md`).
- `hooks/test-memory-router.sh` covering empty state, recall, sensitivity classification, recording, and
  non-destructive curation.
- Launcher status now includes memory budget, learning counts, Vault availability, and curation reasons so
  the start menu can offer memory hygiene before feature/fix work.

### Changed
- Canonical Claude and Codex skill docs now route Phase 2 through local memory recall before optional Vault,
  claude-mem, or web research, and route Phase 7 through automatic learning classification/recording.
- Plugin metadata, README, and publish-safe repo docs now mention bounded memory/recall alongside Project
  Intelligence.

## 0.1.30

Fix **launcher run hygiene edge cases** and clarify project-map baseline maintenance context.

### Fixed
- `hooks/launcher-status.sh` no longer infers `Status: done` from ambiguous Phase 7 lines such as
  `Phase 7: not done yet`; only explicit `Phase 7: done` / `RUN COMPLETE` markers count.
- Launcher maintenance JSON now reports `commits_since_project_map_baseline` as an informational baseline
  count, so callers do not mistake it for a stale-map signal.
- `hooks/test-launcher-status.sh` covers both the legacy Phase 7 completion inference and the ambiguous
  `not done` regression case.

## 0.1.29

Fix **launcher open-item counts for English project-map artifacts**.

### Fixed
- `hooks/launcher-status.sh` now counts Findings and Improvements under German and English section
  headings (`## Offen` / `## Open`, `## Priorisierte Slices` / `## Prioritized Slices`), matching
  Kimiflow's user-language artifact rule.
- `hooks/test-launcher-status.sh` now covers both DE and EN count formats so the launcher cannot silently
  show `0` open items for English projects again.

## 0.1.28

Ship the **context-aware Kimiflow Launcher** and publish-safe repo documentation.

### Added
- `hooks/launcher-status.sh` and `hooks/test-launcher-status.sh` provide a read-only launcher snapshot:
  project-map status/depth, findings, improvement slices, repo docs, dirty working tree, and active/backlog
  runs.
- Empty or vague Kimiflow invocations (`/kimiflow`, `$kimiflow`, `--launcher`, `--menu`) now route through
  a context-aware launcher instead of requiring the user to know the right flag up front.
- Resume safety rules now require revalidation before implementing a parked plan when affected files changed
  since the plan commit, or when the plan basis/affected files are unknown.
- Publish-safe repo docs under `docs/` document architecture, codebase layout, testing, and the public docs
  boundary while keeping raw findings local.

### Changed
- Codex plugin metadata now surfaces the launcher in the default prompt and description.
- Claude and Codex smoke tests assert the launcher contract and helper wiring.

## 0.1.27

Ship **hook labels and publish-safety docs** for the Codex plugin path.

### Changed
- Codex plugin-bundled hooks now carry names/descriptions/status text so plugin UIs can label them instead
  of showing only generic hook numbers.
- Project-map docs now state that raw `.kimiflow/project/` maps and sensitive findings stay local/private;
  repo docs are curated publish-safe derivatives.
- README and compatibility docs clarify local Codex plugin cache paths and update expectations.

## 0.1.26

Ship **Codex plugin visibility improvements** so the Project Intelligence capability is visible in the
Codex plugin detail view and CLI update docs.

### Changed
- Codex plugin display metadata now surfaces Project Intelligence in the plugin detail view: default
  prompts include codebase mapping, architecture/refactoring opportunities, and project documentation,
  and the Codex description mentions `.kimiflow/project/` codebase understanding.
- Codex install docs now recommend the Git marketplace (`swinxx/kimiflow`) for normal installs so
  `codex plugin marketplace upgrade kimiflow` works. Local path marketplaces are documented as a
  development mode because Codex shows the local manifest version but does not upgrade that source type.

## 0.1.25

Ship **Project Intelligence** for kimiflow: a local project map, per-section staleness/refresh, and
optional Vault/repo-doc/improvement publishing.

### Added
- **Vault, repo-doc, and Improve publishing contract (Slice 3)** for standalone project-map runs:
  user-language focus choices (`codebase`, `architecture`, `docs`, opt-in `improve`), explicit storage
  targets (`kimiflow`, `kimiflow+vault`, `kimiflow+vault+repo-docs`), local-first source-of-truth rules,
  and evidence-backed `IMPROVEMENTS.md` / `DOCS-PLAN.md` outputs.
- **Project Map Staleness + Delta Refresh (Slice 2)** via `hooks/project-map-status.sh` and
  `hooks/test-project-map-status.sh`. Kimiflow can now classify existing `.kimiflow/project/INDEX.json`
  sections as `current`, `stale`, `potentially_stale`, or `unknown`, report affected stale sections, and
  mark only selected sections refreshed by updating their hashes/commit metadata.
- **Project Map Bootstrap (Slice 1)** docs/contract for a recommended, skippable project-intelligence
  cache under `.kimiflow/project/`. Kimiflow now documents `--project-map quick|standard|deep|skip`,
  the local artifacts (`INDEX.json`, `FACTS.jsonl`, `CODEBASE.md`, `ARCHITECTURE.md`, `CONVENTIONS.md`,
  `TESTING.md`, `FLOWS.md`, `OPEN-QUESTIONS.md`), user-language output, and token-efficient mapper
  focus rules. This is the foundation for later per-section staleness and Vault/repo-doc publishing.

## 0.1.24

Ship **Codex plugin parity** for kimiflow while keeping the Claude Code path intact.

### Added
- **Codex plugin packaging** via `.codex-plugin/plugin.json`, repo-local `.agents/plugins/marketplace.json`,
  and `skills/kimiflow/SKILL.md`, so Codex can install kimiflow as a plugin-backed skill and invoke it
  explicitly with `$kimiflow` / named Kimiflow prompts.
- **Stable Codex hook installer** (`hooks/install-codex-hooks.sh`) that writes managed wrappers into
  `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}/hooks` and pins `KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT` back to the plugin checkout. This makes
  commit-secret-gate, state-gate, and test-gate work in Codex without relying on experimental
  `plugin_hooks`.
- **Codex structural smoke test** (`hooks/smoke-install-codex.sh`) covering Codex manifests, skill
  frontmatter, optional plugin-hook wiring, temp `CODEX_HOME` wrapper installation, and synthetic Codex
  hook payloads for commit, state, and test gates.

### Changed
- Hook payload parsing now accepts Codex-shaped command/cwd/stop-active fields alongside Claude-shaped
  payloads.
- `resolve-verbosity.sh` now honors `KIMIFLOW_HOST=codex` and uses `${CODEX_HOME:-~/.codex}` for Codex
  global presentation settings.
- Compatibility and README docs now distinguish stable Codex hook wrappers from optional plugin-bundled
  hooks, and document Codex install/invocation flow.

## 0.1.23

Make **slimness an active counter-force** instead of a polite principle. AIs over-build because training
rewards "comprehensive" and complexity carries no felt cost; a "keep it simple" line doesn't counter that.
This applies kimiflow's own philosophy — adversarial + surfaced, not self-assessed — to over-engineering,
while staying token-cheap (the check must not itself become bloat). **Docs/contract only — no new hook.**

### Added
- **Simplicity lens in Phase-7 code-review** (`reference.md` "Review rubric", `SKILL.md` Phase 7). KPI:
  *"what can be deleted while the ACCEPTANCE tests stay green?"* It FLAGs any abstraction/option/error-
  handling/layer **no test or real requirement demands** (earn the abstraction: **≥2 callers or a written
  reason**; single-caller pass-throughs, impossible-state handling, speculative generality) and **proposes
  the smaller version**. Output is **advisory** → `ADVISORIES.md`, triaged at the commit-gate
  (dismiss-with-reason or adopt) — un-ignorable but non-gating (no false-positive thrash).
- **Token-aware by design.** Runs only where a Phase-7 review runs (`small`/`large`); `trivial` is exempt
  and pays nothing. At `small` the dimension is **folded into the existing reviewer** (no new spawn); a
  **dedicated, blind Simplicity prosecutor** (a new Scaling knob) runs only at `large` or when a **size
  tripwire** fires — `git diff --stat` shows a diff much larger than its scope suggests (orchestrator-read,
  no hook), which raises a STOP+justify advisory.
- **"Fold, don't spawn" rule** (`SKILL.md` Agent budget): prefer extending an existing subagent's brief
  over a fresh spawn when it already has the inputs (~hundreds vs ~tens-of-k tokens); spawn a dedicated
  agent only when independence/blindness is the point.

## 0.1.22

Close a `commit-secret-gate` bypass where **`git -C <target> commit`** scoped the gate to the wrong repo.
The hook located the repo from the tool **cwd**, never from the global `-C <path>`, so a secret-looking
staged path could be committed into a kimiflow repo by running git from a different directory
(`git -C <kimiflow-repo> commit -am …` from outside). **Hook + tests + docs only.**

### Fixed
- **`git -C <path>` is now honored** (`hooks/commit-secret-gate.sh`). Repo resolution passes the global
  `-C` option(s) to git, which resolves them cumulatively relative to the cwd — exactly as `git -C` does
  (so `git -C <repo> commit` from any cwd is scoped to `<repo>`). Extraction is scoped to the **global**
  span (before the subcommand), so a reuse-message `-C <commit>` that *follows* `commit` is not mistaken
  for a chdir. Applied to both the precise (jq) path and the fail-closed jq-less fallback (which tests
  each `-C` target independently, so an unresolvable reuse-`-C` can't mask a real one). `git_root`, on an
  unresolvable `-C`, falls back to the cwd itself — never to the hook's own process cwd. bash-3.2-safe.
- **9 new tests** (`hooks/test-commit-secret-gate.sh`), all run with a process-cwd-faithful runner +
  an OUTSIDE-not-kimiflow guard: `-C` commit/`-am`/relative-`-C`/reuse-message-discriminator/no-false-
  positive, plus the jq-less `-C` cases.

### Docs
- **Known residuals updated** (hook header + `README`/`reference.md` "Commit hygiene"): `git -C <path>` is
  honored for **unquoted, space-free** paths; a **quoted `-C` path with a space** stays a residual; and
  `/usr/bin/git` / `command`/`builtin`/`exec git` are documented as command-position-evasion residuals
  alongside `sudo` / `env X=y` (a deliberate non-standard invocation is out of the gate's threat model).

## 0.1.21

Add a deliberate **defer → backlog** outcome to the Phase-4 pre-build summary gate. Until now a ready,
plan-gate-approved plan could only be **approved** (build now) or sent back to **change** — to park it for
later you had to lean on the silent headless/`--prepare` fallback. Now the interactive stop offers an
explicit third choice: "good plan, not now → backlog." **Docs/contract only — no engine, hook, script, or
flag change.**

### Added
- **`SKILL.md` Phase 4 step 7:** the pre-build gate question is now "Approve to build, change something, or
  defer to backlog?" — **defer → backlog** STOPs, marks `Status: backlog` in `STATE.md`, and emits
  `/kimiflow --resume <slug>`. It is the *explicit* twin of the `--prepare`/headless stop (same parked
  state, deliberate intent).
- **`STATE.md` gains a `Status:` line** (`SKILL.md` Phase 0 step 3): `active` while a run is in progress,
  `backlog` once a complete plan is parked before implementation (phases 0–4 done, 5 open); an absent
  `Status:` reads as `active`. The marker is written by every Phase-4 pre-build park reaching 0–4-done
  (the `defer`, headless, and step-6 plan-gate-open `--prepare` stops all share it) — so the backlog view
  can't mislabel one park as different from its identical-state siblings; an earlier stop (Explore,
  mid-phase) stays `active`.
- **`--resume` (no-slug) listing** now surfaces each run's `Status:` (absent → `active`), so deliberately
  parked **backlog** items are visible as a backlog.

### Changed
- **`reference.md` "Pre-build summary gate" Outcomes** documents the `defer → backlog` outcome and the
  explicit-defer-vs-silent-headless distinction (same parked state + marker; the difference is intent).
  Headless / no-answer control-flow is **unchanged** — it still behaves like `--prepare`, now also
  stamping the shared `Status: backlog` marker.

## 0.1.20

Make kimiflow **model-invocable (opt-in)** instead of hard-blocked. Previously `disable-model-invocation:
true` meant the assistant could not launch kimiflow at all — even when you asked it to ("run this with
kimiflow"); only the human typing `/kimiflow` worked. **Docs/contract only — no engine change.**

### Changed
- **`SKILL.md` frontmatter:** `disable-model-invocation: true` → `false`. The assistant can now launch
  kimiflow **on request**. The "only when asked, never unprompted" policy moved into the `description`
  (lead clause), so it's **opt-in by judgment, not a hard flag**. `/kimiflow` slash invocation is
  unchanged.
- **Honest trade-off, documented** (`README.md` EN+DE, `COMPATIBILITY.md`): the no-unprompted-trigger
  guarantee is now **soft** (description-guided), not mechanically enforced. Anyone who wants the hard
  guarantee back can set `disable-model-invocation: true`. `hooks/smoke-install.sh` now asserts
  model-invocation is enabled (not `true`) and rewords the manual no-auto-trigger check accordingly.

> **Takes effect after you update the installed plugin and restart** — a running session keeps the
> frontmatter it loaded at startup.

## 0.1.19

Close the pre-existing literal-TAB gap in `commit-secret-gate` (the LOW from 0.1.18's review).

### Fixed
- **A non-space token separator (TAB/VT/FF/CR) defeated detection** (`hooks/commit-secret-gate.sh`).
  The git/subcommand matchers anchor on a literal space, so `git<TAB>commit …` or `git commit<TAB>--all …`
  made `git_sub` NO-MATCH — skipping the **whole** commit branch (both the staged-path scan and the
  `-a` working-tree scan), letting a tracked/staged secret commit unblocked. Fixed with a single
  normalization: non-newline whitespace is collapsed to spaces (`tr '\t\v\f\r' ' '`) right after the
  command is parsed, so every downstream matcher benefits. Newlines stay as line separators. 4 tab
  unit tests added (82 cases total).

## 0.1.18

Close a second bypass class in `commit-secret-gate`'s `-a`/`--all` detection and make the README's
promise honest. Found by an external review of 0.1.17. **Hook + tests + docs only.**

### Fixed
- **`-a` detection bypass via a shell metachar hidden from the parser** (`hooks/commit-secret-gate.sh`).
  The commit args were split on `;`/`&`/`|` **before** quotes were stripped, so a metachar inside the
  `-m` message (`git commit -m "a; b" -a`) — or a `\`+newline line continuation — truncated the
  extraction and dropped the trailing `-a`, letting a tracked+modified secret commit unblocked. The
  hook now **joins backslash-newline continuations and strips quoted spans first, then** splits and
  detects `-a`/`--all`. Safe because this branch reads only flags, never pathspec/filenames. Unit
  tests added for quoted `;`/`&`/`|`, the `--all` variant, and a newline continuation (78 cases).

### Changed
- **Honest residuals, in docs and as locked tests** (`README.md`, `reference.md`,
  `hooks/test-commit-secret-gate.sh`). The README no longer implies it blocks "any" secret commit; it
  now names the **backstop, not complete secret protection** framing and the known gaps. Documented +
  test-locked as known ALLOW (regex ≠ shell parser): an `env X=y`/`sudo` prefix (defeats the
  command-position anchor, gate-wide), an **escaped quote** in the message, and an explicit **pathspec
  commit** (`git commit <path>`). A pre-existing literal-tab-after-`git` gap is also known (LOW).

## 0.1.17

Close a real bypass in the `commit-secret-gate` hook and document its boundaries honestly. The gate
only inspected the **index** (`git diff --cached`), so a secret-looking file committed via implicit
staging slipped through. **Hook + tests + docs only — no new mechanism or dependency.**

### Fixed
- **`commit-secret-gate` — `git commit -a`/`--all`/`-am` bypass** (`hooks/commit-secret-gate.sh`). These
  forms auto-stage tracked working-tree modifications *at commit time*, after the PreToolUse hook has
  already read the index — so a modified, already-tracked `.env` (etc.) was committed unblocked. The
  hook now also scans tracked-but-unstaged modifications (`git diff --name-only`) when `-a`/`--all` is
  present. Flag detection matches `a` before any value-taking short option (m/c/C/F/S/u), so bundled
  forms `-am`/`-vam`/`-qam` are caught while `-ma` (a message), `-uall`, `-Sabc` and `--allow-empty` are
  correctly ignored. Unit tests added (`hooks/test-commit-secret-gate.sh`, 70 cases).

### Changed
- **Honest scope docs** (`reference.md` "Commit hygiene" + hook header). The gate no longer claims to
  block "any `git commit`": it now states the `-a`/`--all` coverage **and** the residual limitations —
  an explicit **pathspec commit** (`git commit <path>`) of an already-tracked secret is **not** covered
  (parsing a pathspec from a shell string needs an AST, not a regex). **Bottom line: the gate is a
  path-hygiene backstop, not complete secret protection** — pair it with `.gitignore` discipline + a
  content scanner (gitleaks/trufflehog) and don't track secrets in the first place.

## 0.1.16

Add **claude-mem** as a second *optional* memory-recall provider in Phase 2, alongside the Obsidian
vault. Recall beats re-research: kimiflow now searches cross-session memory too, when it's present.
**Documentation/contract only — no new hook, script, CI, or gate logic; no hard dependency.**

### Changed
- **Phase 2 recall is now provider-agnostic** (`SKILL.md`, `reference.md`). Step 1 ("Recall before
  researching") searches whichever optional providers are connected — the **vault** (notes MCP, e.g.
  Obsidian) and **claude-mem** (cross-session memory MCP, e.g. `memory_search`/`observation_search`).
  Each is independent and graceful: present → use, absent → note in `STATE.md` + continue. A fresh
  relevant hit from either replaces web research. Detection is **per-run by tool availability**, so a
  later-installed provider is picked up on the next run.
- **claude-mem is search-only.** kimiflow recalls from it but never writes to it (it auto-captures
  sessions); verified findings still save to the vault. The "Always last — vault-save" step is
  unchanged.
- **New `reference.md` "Memory recall (Phase 2)"** section documents the two optional providers, the
  graceful-skip contract, and per-run detection. "Vault conventions" stays for vault save-back.
- **README** ("Vault memory layer" / "Vault-Memory-Schicht", EN + DE) names claude-mem as the second
  optional source — search-only, graceful skip, independent of the vault.

## 0.1.15

Make STATE-persistence **enforced**, not a prose ask the orchestrator can rationalize past — closing a
gap found when a "lean" doc run skipped `.kimiflow/<slug>/STATE.md` and lost resumability.

### Added
- **`state-gate` hook** (`hooks/state-gate.sh`, PreToolUse/Bash). Intercepts the review-gate resolver
  call (`resolve-review-gate.sh .kimiflow/<slug>/findings …`) and **denies it fail-closed unless that
  run's `STATE.md` exists and is non-empty** — so no gate verdict (→ no commit) without persisted run
  state. The safety-critical `resolve-review-gate.sh` is **untouched** (separate hook, not a resolver
  edit). Auto-active only in kimiflow repos; needs no jq; unit-tested (`hooks/test-state-gate.sh`, 11
  cases incl. a no-jq path); wired into `hooks.json` + smoke-test. **Honest limit:** catches every run
  that reaches a gate (everything that commits), not a `--prepare`/`trivial` run that stops before any
  gate — those are covered by the prose + eval below.
- **Behavioral-eval scenario 11** (`evals/scenarios/11-state-persistence.md`): does the orchestrator
  still persist `STATE.md` under "keep it in chat to stay lean" pressure?

### Changed
- **SKILL.md "Persist phase progress"** — explicit negation: not optional, not terse-trimmable;
  "small / lean / doc-only run" is not an exemption (only `trivial` runs without the loop). Plus a
  **"Narration ≠ persistence"** clause on the terse-output rule: terse suppresses *talking about* state
  in chat, it never removes writing `STATE.md` / the phase artifacts to disk.

## 0.1.14

A review-contract sharpening: reviewers judge against intent, acceptance, the diff and actual behavior
— **tests are evidence, not the boundary of truth**, not the limit of it. Plus a second eval dimension
that calibrates reviewer *judgement* (not just gate-holding). **Documentation and scenarios only — no
new mechanism, CI, or gate logic.**

### Changed
- **Review rubric — "Tests are evidence, not the boundary of truth"** (`reference.md`). A reviewer
  judges against intent/acceptance/diff/behavior; a green suite may *support* a finding but never
  *refutes* one grounded in code/spec ("not covered by a test" is not a counter-argument). An untested
  real risk is still a finding, and missing coverage of a real risk can itself be a finding —
  anti-hallucination still binds: **severity = provable impact**.
- **Phase 7 reviewer brief** (`SKILL.md`): hunt untested-but-real requirement gaps; a green suite never
  refutes a finding grounded in code/spec. Spine-terse; detail in `reference.md`.
- **Evals reframed as release-calibration** (`evals/README.md`): a mirror read around a release, not a
  runtime oracle; the model under test never sees a findings list; judged post-hoc. Not "test cases."

### Added
- **Reviewer-calibration eval dimension** (`evals/reviewer-calibration.md`): pressure-tests whether a
  reviewer judges cleanly (writes the warranted finding) under green CI / authority / time, vs. the
  tests-as-truth failure. Hidden-notes rule (the answer key never enters the reviewer's context),
  held/soft-crack/hard-crack judging, and an explicit anti-goal — **no gold list, no CI grading of LLM
  reviewers**.
- **Three reviewer pressure scenarios** (`evals/scenarios/reviewer/`): green-but-acceptance-unmet, a
  referenceable defect no test exercises, and a test narrower than the intent.

## 0.1.13

A hardening pass from a second audit: an exact review-gate cap contract, an optional secret
content-scan advisory, and an install smoke-test that guards plugin/skill invocation. This release
also re-syncs the GitHub tag/release, which had lagged at `0.1.0` while the plugin advanced.

### Added
- **Optional secret content-scan advisory** (`hooks/secret-content-scan.sh`). Complements the
  path-only `commit-secret-gate` by scanning the **staged content** for in-source secrets via
  `gitleaks` (else `trufflehog`) when one is installed; findings become `FLAG` advisories in
  `ADVISORIES.md` for commit-gate triage. **Non-gating**, with a graceful STDERR skip when no scanner
  is present — the fail-closed path-hygiene gate is untouched. Wired into Phase 7; unit-tested
  (PATH-mocked) and added to CI.
- **Install smoke-test** (`hooks/smoke-install.sh`). Structural, runnable without a live Claude Code
  session: validates the manifests + version consistency, the `SKILL.md` frontmatter
  (`disable-model-invocation: true`, `user-invocable` not disabled, `name`/`description`/
  `argument-hint`), the `hooks.json` wiring, and fires `commit-secret-gate` against synthetic
  PreToolUse stdin. Prints the manual live-CC checklist and references the Claude Code invocation
  issues it guards (anthropics/claude-code#26251, #22345). CI hard gate.

### Fixed
- **Review-gate cap fires at the round limit, not one past it.** `resolve-review-gate.sh` flagged
  `cap-reached` only at `round > cap` (round 4 under `--cap 3`) — one round past the documented
  "cap 3 reached → stop". Now `round >= cap`: round 3 under `--cap 3` with open findings →
  `cap-reached`, so a run does **at most 3 review rounds** (was effectively 4). TDD-covered; the
  reappearance test gets `--cap 5` headroom to keep exercising its own branch.

## 0.1.12

A self-applied claim/evidence remediation (kimiflow's own `evidence-before-assertion` standard turned
on its own docs) + eval-suite hardening + secret-gate scoping. **Docs / evals / tests only — engine
behavior unchanged; `secret_re` and all gate logic untouched.**

### Added
- **`COMPATIBILITY.md`** — every Claude Code primitive kimiflow depends on (PreToolUse/Stop hooks,
  `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}`/`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, `TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`, subagent types,
  `disable-model-invocation`, the manifests), classed load-bearing vs graceful, with a version-bump
  smoke checklist. Last verified: Claude Code 2.1.186.
- **Eval suite expanded to 10 scenarios** — `07-scope-gate` (both directions),
  `08-advisory-triage-failclosed`, `09-headless-build-gate`, `10-terse-output`; an open-ended tier
  beside the MCQ tier; and a run procedure requiring n≥3 per pass + a CLAUDE.md-free / attribution-
  forcing setup (addresses the ambient-CLAUDE.md confound in the method, not just the prose).
- **`evals/outcomes.md`** — an honest, currently-empty log for outcome quality (kimiflow vs a plain
  session); field notes, not a benchmark. Nothing is cited from it while empty.

### Changed
- **Outward claims aligned with evidence.** The 0.1.11 "6/6 held" line now carries the
  ambient-CLAUDE.md confound caveat (only 3/6 cleanly attributable). README weakened "enforced, not
  self-reported" → "a `done` self-report can't inflate past open blockers"; `reference.md` "Review
  rubric" now states what the gate does **not** guarantee (sound over its inputs, not a completeness
  proof). Added a "Why kimiflow over plan-mode + a `CLAUDE.md`" section.
- **Scenario pass-criteria tightened** — every scenario now requires the citation to name its
  `SKILL.md`/`reference.md` location; the cartoonish distractors in 01/02 became tempting near-misses.
- **`commit-secret-gate` claim scoped to path-hygiene** — README / `reference.md` now state it is
  filename/path hygiene, **not** secret-in-source detection, and point to gitleaks/trufflehog for
  in-source secrets. Doc pattern list synced to the regex (`.asc`, the four concrete SSH keytypes,
  `.p12`/`.pfx`). The blunt no-jq fallback's intentional over-block is documented and locked by tests.
- **`LEDGER.md` schema** gains approx-token-cost + post-commit-outcome columns (a cheap ROI
  instrument) and an honest "when is `large` worth it?" note.

## 0.1.11

### Added
- **Behavioral-eval tier (`evals/`, out-of-CI, on-demand).** A subagent pressure-test suite for the
  six highest-stakes gates (commit-gate, diagnosis-before-fix, plan-gate cap/anti-oscillation,
  deletion caller-verification, evidence-before-assertion, anti-hallucination). Each scenario loads a
  fresh subagent with the real deployed skill and a multi-pressure situation, then checks whether the
  gate holds and is cited — the `testing-skills-with-subagents` (TDD-for-process-docs) tier. LLM-judged
  and variant by design, so never wired into CI; a one-line Scaling-knobs pointer makes it
  discoverable. First run (2026-06-23): 6/6 held, but only 3/6 (03/05/06) are cleanly attributable
  to kimiflow's own text — 01/02/04 were confounded by the ambient global `CLAUDE.md` (see
  `evals/README.md` → "Known limitation"). Treat as a smoke pass, not a robustness proof.

## 0.1.10

### Added
- **Opt-in `🧭 Explore` phase (`--explore`).** A divergent front-end that runs *before* the
  convergent Phase 1 Clarify: 2–3 codebase-grounded explorer subagents each propose a **distinct
  direction** (minimal / robust / sideways), the orchestrator synthesizes a terse menu, and the user
  picks one — which then seeds Clarify. Forced with `/kimiflow --explore <idea>`; otherwise kimiflow
  offers once on an open-ended request (decline / headless → normal routing, never blocks). Pick →
  continue into the loop, or stop with an `EXPLORE.md` option memo and `--resume` later. Feature-mode
  only (a fix/cleanup that surfaces → suggests `--fix`/`--audit`). Purely additive — non-explore runs
  are behaviorally unchanged; no new hook/script (the pick is a human gate).

## 0.1.9

### Changed
- **Slimmed `SKILL.md` to a thinner state-machine spine.** The always-loaded orchestrator spec was
  compressed in 12 spots where the detail already lives in `reference.md` — in-line explanation
  replaced with terse imperatives + section pointers (Modes, Core principles, Phase 0/2/4/7).
  **Behavior-preserving:** every gate, threshold, transition and mechanical contract is kept inline
  or reachable via a working `reference.md` pointer (verified clause-by-clause by an independent
  adversarial audit; all pointers resolve; `reference.md` unchanged; hook tests green). ≈−8% bytes /
  −9% words off the per-run orchestrator context.

## 0.1.8

### Fixed
- **commit-secret-gate — bulk-add false positive across subcommands.** The bulk-add guard scanned
  the whole compound command for a bare `.` / `-A` / `--all`, so a named `git add foo` combined with
  a `.` pathspec in a DIFFERENT subcommand (e.g. `git add foo && git grep -- .`) was wrongly refused
  as `git add .`. The check is now scoped to the `git add` invocation's own args (segment after `add`,
  bounded by `;&|`). Genuine bulk adds (`git add .`, `-A`, `--all`, `git add foo .`) stay blocked;
  tests added both ways.

## 0.1.7

### Added
- **Mechanized review gate.** The binary Phase-4 / Phase-7 review decision is now a single tested,
  deterministic resolver `hooks/resolve-review-gate.sh` instead of a prose-instructed `grep | wc -l`.
  It validates findings completeness + canonical grammar, counts open BLOCKER/HIGH, and applies
  anti-oscillation (`cap → oscillation → reappearance`), echoing one stable machine line
  `VERDICT⇥count⇥reason_code⇥detail`. **Fail-closed** on any incompleteness / malformation / misuse
  (never a false `OPEN`); **language-agnostic** — operates only on the `FINDING <SEVERITY> <ref> :: <reason>`
  abstraction (arbitrary UTF-8 refs/reasons, no source or per-language logic). Unit-tested (22 cases),
  wired into CI as a hard gate.

### Changed
- `reference.md` "Review rubric" and `SKILL.md` (Phase 4 / Phase 7) now delegate the gate count to
  `resolve-review-gate.sh` (the single source of truth); gate semantics unchanged (mechanized 1:1).

## 0.1.6

### Fixed
- **commit-secret-gate — compound code filenames:** the keyword deny-list flagged a secret-word
  wherever it was bounded by `[/._-]`, so the gate's own files (`commit-secret-gate.sh`,
  `test-commit-secret-gate.sh`) and source files like `secret-manager.ts` were refused — a false
  positive the "commit from outside a run" hint couldn't resolve. The **trailing** word-boundary now
  excludes `-`: a secret-word is still caught as a path's trailing token (`client-secret.txt`,
  `aws-credentials.yml`, `prod-secret.json`) but no longer mid-name. Leading `-` kept; tests added
  for both directions.

### Changed
- **resolve-verbosity:** dropped the unused standalone `origin` mode — it was documented and
  unit-tested but never invoked by the orchestrator (`onboard-check` already encapsulates the sole
  origin-based decision). `get`/`onboard-check`/`set` unchanged; an `origin` arg now degrades to `get`.
- Renamed leftover internal `flow_root()` → `git_root()` in commit-secret-gate (flow→kimiflow rename).

### Removed
- `design/` plans/specs for already-shipped features — trims the published repo (git history retains them).

## 0.1.5

### Fixed
- **commit-secret-gate — suffix-style `.env`:** the secret pattern matched only dotfile `.env`;
  `prod.env`/`dev.env`/`.envrc`-style names now match too.
- **commit-secret-gate — combined add+commit:** a `git add <secret> && git commit` in one command
  now has its add-targets scanned, not just the index.
- **commit-secret-gate — no-jq fail-closed:** the jq-less detection was quote-fragile, so
  `git -C "…" commit` / `git -c k="v" commit` slipped through; now denied (quote-robust).
- **test-gate — no-jq loop-break:** the `stop_hook_active` break now works without jq (grep
  fallback), so a red marker can no longer re-block forever; a stderr hint recommends jq.
- SKILL.md YAML frontmatter (`description` quoted) — fixes the GitHub render error.

### Added
- Unit tests for `commit-secret-gate`, `test-gate`, and the test-weakening scanner, all wired into
  CI as hard gates. CI now also validates `marketplace.json`.

### Changed
- Hooks documented as **plugin-mode only**; secret-pattern wording corrected (incl. `.env`/`.envrc`,
  `access_token`/`auth_token`).
- Removed build-time external-toolchain references from the published repo; design artifacts moved
  to `design/`. The audit-mode lens is described in kimiflow's own terms.

## 0.1.4

### Added
- **Audit / cleanup mode** — a third mode (`/kimiflow --audit <path>` or auto-detected) that runs an
  existence-first cleanup lens over a bounded target: finds tagged slices (`yagni`/`delete`/`shrink`/`stdlib`) with
  repo-wide caller-greps and git-history-freshness, presents them for approval (Phase-4 summary gate),
  then executes one slice = one commit with a per-slice verify gate. Caller-grep is a documented
  MINIMUM; tests + do-NOT-touch + adversarial "refute the cut" verification are the backstop. Engine unchanged.

## 0.1.3

### Added
- **Pre-build summary gate** — at the end of Phase 4 (after the plan-gate opens), kimiflow
  prints a structured summary (problem/goal · decisions · plan · tests/acceptance · risks +
  artifact paths) and **waits for your OK** before implementing. Project-local toggle
  `.kimiflow/build-gate` (`on`/`off`, default `on`), set via `--settings`; never global
  (self-contained rule). Control-flow only — the engine is unchanged. Toggle resolved by the
  unit-tested `hooks/resolve-build-gate.sh`.
- **Native phase task-list** — Phase 0 creates a glance widget (`TaskCreate`/`TaskUpdate`) of
  the phases being run; complements `STATE.md` and the colored markers, replaces narrated status.

### Changed
- **Deletions are now caller-verified** — removing code requires a recorded zero-caller proof
  (`grep`); an unproven deletion is a code-review BLOCKER. Load-bearing-but-removable-looking code
  goes on a do-NOT-touch list instead.
- **Plan tasks carry a `Consumes:`/`Produces:` interface block** for parallel/worktree implementers.
- **`large`-scope plans record 2–3 considered alternatives** + the selecting trade-off.

## 0.1.2

### Added
- **MIT license** — a `LICENSE` file + `license` field in the manifest, so the README's
  "anyone can install/fork" is actually covered (previously de-facto all-rights-reserved).
- **CI runs the unit tests** — `hooks/test-resolve-verbosity.sh` is now a hard gate in CI
  (was `bash -n` + JSON validation + advisory shellcheck only; the green tests were never run).
- **Artifact-economy rule** — on-disk artifacts (re-read by every subagent each round, the
  dominant token cost) are written information-dense; density never trades away rigor.

### Changed
- **First-run onboarding is now mechanical** — `resolve-verbosity.sh onboard-check` decides
  `ASK`/`SKIP` in the unit-tested script (`ASK` iff no project/global config and no flag), so it
  fires reliably on a fresh project and never nags a configured one. 0.1.1's prompt was
  orchestrator-judged and could be silently skipped.
- **Stale `flow` → `kimiflow`** in the hooks' headers and operator-visible deny/block messages.
- **SKILL.md / reference.md prose compacted** — decoration removed, telegraphic phrasing;
  every rule, threshold, path, and acceptance-criteria precision unchanged.

## 0.1.1

### Added
- **Display verbosity** — `quiet` / `balanced` / `verbose` levels that change **only** visible
  output; the engine (gates, artifacts, evidence, subagents, thresholds) is identical at every
  level. One-off `--quiet` / `--verbose`, setter `--set-verbosity`, a `--settings` dialog
  (level + scope), and a one-time first-run prompt (headless/skip → `balanced`, no block).
  Precedence `flag > project > global > balanced`, resolved by a unit-tested helper
  (`hooks/resolve-verbosity.sh`). Only verbosity may live globally (`~/.claude/kimiflow/verbosity`).

### Changed
- **State dir renamed `.flow/` → `.kimiflow/`** (self-documenting).
- **Fix-mode research** now names `WebSearch` / context7 / `WebFetch` explicitly (parity with the
  feature path).
- **Vault research is freshness-aware** — a hit is weighed by its `date:`; a fresh hit that
  answers the question replaces web research, and re-search uses a **different search vector**
  rather than repeating a prior query.

## 0.1.0 — Initial release

> Pre-1.0: early and evolving — interfaces and gate details may change between 0.x versions.

A user-invoked Claude Code skill: a disciplined feature & bug-fix loop with real,
mechanical quality gates.

### Added
- **8-phase loop** — scope-gate → clarify → understand/diagnose → plan → plan-gate →
  implement → verify → code-review/commit — with **colored phase markers**
  (⚪🔵🟣⚫🟡🟠🟤🟢) so a run reads at a glance in Claude Code.
- **Binary gates, no numeric score.** Reviewers write structured findings to per-round,
  orchestrator-immutable files; the gate counts open BLOCKER/HIGH **mechanically** and
  **fails closed** on missing/empty/malformed input — no self-reported counts, no re-count.
- **Fix mode** — reproduce, prove the root cause (`file:line`), and research the correct
  fix *before* fixing.
- **Self-contained** — every gate/threshold lives in the skill + `reference.md`, never in
  a personal/global `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Bundled hooks** (active only in kimiflow repos — a `.kimiflow/` dir at the git root):
  - `commit-secret-gate` (PreToolUse) — blocks staged secrets and bulk `git add -A`/`.`;
    **fails closed without `jq`**.
  - `test-gate` (opt-in Stop hook) — blocks finishing on red tests; runs **only a local,
    untracked marker** (a committed `.kimiflow/test-gate` is refused — no drive-by `eval`).
  - `test-weakening-scan` (advisory) — flags deleted tests / added skips / removed
    assertions to a non-gating channel, surfaced at the commit-gate.

### Requirements
- `jq` on `PATH` (used by the hooks).

### Notes
- Renamed from `claude-flow` to **kimiflow** to de-collide from `ruvnet/claude-flow`.
