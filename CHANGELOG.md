# Changelog

Notable changes to **kimiflow**. Versions track `.claude-plugin/plugin.json`.

## 0.1.0 — Initial release

> Pre-1.0: early and evolving — interfaces and gate details may change between 0.x versions.

A user-invoked Claude Code skill: a disciplined feature & bug-fix loop with real,
mechanical quality gates.

### Added
- **8-phase loop** — scope-gate → clarify → understand/diagnose → plan → plan-gate →
  implement → verify → code-review/commit — with **colored phase markers**
  (⚪🔵🟣⚫🟡🟠🟤🟢) so a run reads at a glance in Claude Code.
- **Binary gates, no numeric score.** Reviewers write structured findings to per-round,
  orchestrator-immutable files; the gate counts open BLOCKER/HIGH **mechanically** and
  **fails closed** on missing/empty/malformed input — no self-reported counts, no re-count.
- **Fix mode** — reproduce, prove the root cause (`file:line`), and research the correct
  fix *before* fixing.
- **Self-contained** — every gate/threshold lives in the skill + `reference.md`, never in
  a personal/global `CLAUDE.md`.
- **Bundled hooks** (active only in kimiflow repos — a `.flow/` dir at the git root):
  - `commit-secret-gate` (PreToolUse) — blocks staged secrets and bulk `git add -A`/`.`;
    **fails closed without `jq`**.
  - `test-gate` (opt-in Stop hook) — blocks finishing on red tests; runs **only a local,
    untracked marker** (a committed `.flow/test-gate` is refused — no drive-by `eval`).
  - `test-weakening-scan` (advisory) — flags deleted tests / added skips / removed
    assertions to a non-gating channel, surfaced at the commit-gate.

### Requirements
- `jq` on `PATH` (used by the hooks).

### Notes
- Renamed from `claude-flow` to **kimiflow** to de-collide from `ruvnet/claude-flow`.
