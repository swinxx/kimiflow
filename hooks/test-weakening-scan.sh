# flow — test-weakening scan (ADVISORY, never blocks). Invoked by flow in Phase 7
# (NOT auto-registered as a hook). Scans the staged diff for signs that tests were
# weakened to go green and prints FLAG advisory lines to stdout. flow routes these
# to .flow/<slug>/ADVISORIES.md and forces human triage at the commit-gate
# (dismiss = legit refactor, or promote = a real finding).
#
# The pattern set is a MINIMUM (see reference.md → "Review rubric"): SEMANTIC
# weakening — changed expected values, loosened tolerances, a test rewritten to a
# no-op without a marker — is NOT detected. Surface, do not trust as complete.
