description: "Codex port of the Kimiflow feature and bug-fix loop. Use ONLY when the user explicitly asks for Kimiflow, says \"with kimiflow\" or \"run kimiflow\", mentions the $kimiflow skill, or asks to build/fix through Kimiflow gates. Do NOT auto-trigger on ordinary feature, bug, refactor, review, or cleanup requests."

# Kimiflow For Codex

Run the Kimiflow loop for the user's request.

This Codex skill is the host-native entrypoint for the same Kimiflow engine used by the Claude Code plugin. The canonical workflow lives in the installed plugin root (`SKILL.md` and `reference.md`); read those files before running any phase, then apply the Codex host map below.

## Invocation

Treat these as explicit Kimiflow requests:

- `$kimiflow`
- `@kimiflow`
- `$kimiflow --launcher` / `$kimiflow --menu`
- `$kimiflow <feature-or-bug>`
- `@kimiflow <feature-or-bug>`
- `run kimiflow ...`
- `with kimiflow ...`
- `build/fix this through the Kimiflow gates`

Do not invoke Kimiflow merely because the user asks for a normal feature, bug fix, cleanup, audit, or review.

## Host Map

Before invoking any Kimiflow helper script, establish the plugin root from this installed skill file:

1. Treat `KIMIFLOW_SKILL_DIR` as the absolute directory that contains this `skills/kimiflow/SKILL.md` file.
2. Export `KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT="$(cd "$KIMIFLOW_SKILL_DIR/../.." && pwd)"`.
3. Export `KIMIFLOW_HOST=codex`.

Never invoke helper scripts through a two-parent relative `hooks` path from the user's project cwd; Codex shell commands run in the workspace, not in the installed skill directory.

Apply the canonical Kimiflow workflow from `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/SKILL.md` with these Codex substitutions:

- `/kimiflow` in user-facing text means `$kimiflow` or an explicit "run Kimiflow" prompt in Codex.
- `/kimiflow`, `/kimiflow --launcher`, and `/kimiflow --menu` mean `$kimiflow`, `$kimiflow --launcher`, and `$kimiflow --menu` in Codex. Empty or vague explicit Kimiflow invocations open the context-aware launcher and must use `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/launcher-status.sh` for the status snapshot.
- `/kimiflow --project-map <quick|standard|deep|skip>` means `$kimiflow --project-map <quick|standard|deep|skip>` in Codex. Missing maps, per-section staleness checks, `coverage`-based Phase-2 depth (`compressed|targeted|full`), recommended-but-skippable delta refreshes, focus selection, storage targets, and Improve/Docs publishing use the same canonical Project Map rules and `hooks/project-map-status.sh`. Repo docs are publish-safe derivatives only; raw `.kimiflow/project/` maps and sensitive findings stay local/private unless the user explicitly overrides that policy.
- `/kimiflow --verify-feature <feature-or-path>` means `$kimiflow --verify-feature <feature-or-path>` in Codex. Existing feature checks are review-only and use the canonical lens workflow from `reference.md`: small/fast read-only lens agents may collect candidate issues when available, but the Codex orchestrator must verify candidates before promoting them to findings.
- Phase-7 code review uses the canonical Review Ensemble from `reference.md`: build one compact review packet, run focused `bug-regression`, `failure-security`, and when relevant `integration-contract` candidate lenses, then let the Codex orchestrator verify candidates before writing canonical `FINDING` lines to the gate. Raw `CANDIDATE` files never count as blockers until promoted.
- Kimiflow's Active Session Contract uses `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/active-run.sh` in Codex. Once a user explicitly starts Kimiflow and an active session exists, follow-up prompts remain inside that run unless the user explicitly exits, aborts, parks, fails, or switches workflow. Use `append-item`, `mark-built`, `mark-accepted`, `mark-rejected`, `drop-item`, `refresh-baseline`, and `finish|park|fail|abort --write` exactly as the canonical workflow describes; do not route follow-up changes to another skill while `.kimiflow/session/ACTIVE_RUN.json` is present.
- Kimiflow's Working-tree start gate uses `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/working-tree-gate.sh` in Codex. Normal write runs require `WORKING_TREE_GATE OPEN` before slugging or editing; if the gate is `CLOSED`, stop and ask the user to commit/stash/clean first.
- Kimiflow's fix-mode Red-Green Gate uses `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/red-green-gate.sh` in Codex. A fix run records Red/Green/Regression evidence in `BUG-REPRO.md`; `RED_GREEN_GATE OPEN` is required before Phase 7, learning promotion, or `Status: done`.
- Kimiflow's local diagnostics advisory uses `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lsp-diagnostics.sh` in Codex. It runs a bounded set of existing local diagnostics tools or one untracked `.kimiflow/lsp-diagnostics` command, never installs anything, rejects free-form CLI commands, classifies `FLAG`s by changed-file relevance, and routes them to `ADVISORIES.md`.
- Kimiflow's Memory Router and Learning Loop use `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/memory-router.sh` in Codex. Launcher status exposes memory budget, learning counts, feature-check findings, run-history/usage/economics/provider health, Obsidian auto-detection/auth status, pending provider sync handoffs, pending proposal notifications, Vault availability, and curation reasons; Phase 2 recall and Phase 7 learning use the same canonical rules as Claude Code, including current-only recall, bounded old-run history search over review summaries and canonical `findings/*.md`, run-local `RECALL.json`, use-count/last-used metrics, bounded recall/history cost events, run-level `MEMORY-ECONOMICS.jsonl`, `metrics`, lifecycle curation, optional Vault provider manifests, Obsidian `provider health|setup|detect|connect`, Terminal-wizard setup via `hooks/vault-mcp-open-terminal.sh`, MCP-backed direct search/write readiness, Vault prefetch/sync handoffs, superseded stale evidence rows, outside-repo evidence path sanitization, use-aware always-on memory, local FTS recall indexing, user-profile memory, consolidation, security scanning, and review-only rule/skill proposals with `--approve`, `--reject`, `--apply`, `PROPOSALS.jsonl`, and skill drafts under `.kimiflow/project/SKILL-DRAFTS/`.
- `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT:-$CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}` means the installed Kimiflow plugin root. In Codex, use `KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT`.
- When invoking Kimiflow helper scripts from Codex, set `KIMIFLOW_HOST=codex`.
- `TaskCreate` / `TaskUpdate` means use Codex's task plan/status updates.
- Claude Code subagent names map to Codex subagents as follows:
  - `Explore` or read-only codebase exploration: use a Codex `explorer` subagent when subagents are available.
  - implementation or fix worker: use a Codex `worker` subagent when useful.
  - planning, review, verification, or general work: use a Codex `default` subagent unless a more specific configured agent exists.
- `WebSearch` / `WebFetch` means Codex web/search or another available current-source tool. For current external technical facts, prefer primary sources.
- `CLAUDE.md` is a Claude project convention file. In Codex, read `AGENTS.md` first, and also read `CLAUDE.md` if it exists because Kimiflow historically treats it as a conventions hint.

## Gate Commands

Use the bundled scripts as the only mechanical source of truth:

- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/resolve-review-gate.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/plan-blocker-gate.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/resolve-build-gate.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/resolve-verbosity.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/working-tree-gate.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/current-state-gate.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/red-green-gate.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/lsp-diagnostics.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/launcher-status.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/active-run.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/memory-router.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/test-weakening-scan.sh`
- `$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/secret-content-scan.sh`

For Codex invocations, call them with `KIMIFLOW_HOST=codex`, for example:

```bash
KIMIFLOW_HOST=codex "$KIMIFLOW_PLUGIN_ROOT/hooks/resolve-review-gate.sh" .kimiflow/<slug>/findings --round 1 --expect code-verified
```

Do not replace these scripts with model judgment. If a resolver says the gate is closed, the gate is closed.

## Output

Reply in the user's language. Keep Kimiflow's terse output rule from the canonical workflow: visible chat is control-plane only; artifacts and evidence go to files.
